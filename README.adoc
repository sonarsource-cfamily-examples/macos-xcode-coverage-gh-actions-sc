*This project is analysed on https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=sonarsource-cfamily-examples_macos-xcode-coverage-gh-actions-sc[SonarCloud]!*

:note-caption: :information_source:
NOTE: This simple example ignores https://docs.sonarcloud.io/advanced-setup/languages/c-c-objective-c/#analysis-cache[analysis cache] and https://docs.sonarcloud.io/advanced-setup/languages/c-c-objective-c/#parallel-code-scan[multithreaded execution] both of which can boost analysis significantly.

It is very easy to analyze a C, C++ and Objective-C project on SonarCloud with code coverage and https://docs.sonarcloud.io/getting-started/github/[GitHub Actions]:

. Create a `sonar-project.properties` file to store your configuration
. In your `.github/workflows/build.yml` file:
.. Download the https://docs.sonarcloud.io/advanced-setup/ci-based-analysis/sonarscanner-cli/[Sonar Scanner]
.. Download the https://docs.sonarcloud.io/advanced-setup/languages/c-c-objective-c/#analysis-steps-using-build-wrapper[Build Wrapper]
.. Wrap your compilation with the Build Wrapper
.. Run the test binaries with `-enableCodeCoverage YES` to count covered lines
.. Run link:xccov-to-generic.sh[xccov-to-generic.sh] on the `*.xcresult` files to produce a https://docs.sonarcloud.io/enriching/test-coverage/generic-test-data/[Generic Test Data] format that is compatible with SonarCloud
.. Run `sonar-scanner` as the final step
* Point the sonar.coverageReportPaths property to the generated coverage-report file
. Make sure that you have your token stored as a secret in your repository (`SONAR_TOKEN`). You can request new tokens using https://sonarcloud.io/account/security/[Account/Security page].

You can take a look at the link:sonar-project.properties[sonar-project.properties] and link:.github/workflows/build.yml[build.yml] to see it in practice.

== Warnings

The following warning may appear during invocation of `/build-wrapper-macosx-x86`. To best of our knowledge does not affect the result of the analysis:
----
dyld: warning: could not load inserted library '/Users/runner/.sonar/build-wrapper-macosx-x86/libinterceptor.dylib' into hardened process because no suitable image found.  Did find:
	/Users/runner/.sonar/build-wrapper-macosx-x86/libinterceptor.dylib: code signature in (/Users/runner/.sonar/build-wrapper-macosx-x86/libinterceptor.dylib) not valid for use in process using Library Validation: mapped file has no cdhash, completely unsigned? Code has to be at least ad-hoc signed.
----

= MacOS\XCodeBuild

A build of the https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] on a MacOS using XCode build system.

To build the code run from the repository root directory:

= Code Description

An example of a flawed C++ code. The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is meant to be compiled with different build systems using different CI pipelines on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is forked into other repositories in https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples[this collection] to add a specific build system, platform, and CI.
The downstream repositories are analyzed either with https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] or https://sonarcloud.io/[SonarCloud].
