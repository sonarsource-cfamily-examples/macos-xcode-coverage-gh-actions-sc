*The test coverage shown here works on both SonarQube and SonarCloud. This project is analyzed on https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=sonarsource-cfamily-examples_macos-xcode-coverage-gh-actions-sc[SonarCloud]!*

:note-caption: :information_source:
NOTE: This simple example aims at demonstrating code coverage in action. It explains how to add coverage on a project for which the analysis is already configured. Analysis configuration examples are available https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples?q=xcode[here]. +
Adding code coverage is done the same way regardless of using the Build Wrapper or a Compilation Database to cconfigure the analysis.


After your build and before your running `sonar-scanner`, proceed with the following steps:

. Run the test binaries with `-enableCodeCoverage YES` to count covered lines
. Run link:xccov-to-generic.sh[xccov-to-generic.sh] on the `*.xcresult` files to produce a https://docs.sonarcloud.io/enriching/test-coverage/generic-test-data/[Generic Test Data] format that is compatible with SonarCloud
. Run `sonar-scanner` as the final step
* Point the sonar.coverageReportPaths property to the generated coverage-report file

You can take a look at the link:sonar-project.properties[sonar-project.properties] and link:.github/workflows/build.yml[build.yml] to see it in practice.

= MacOS\XCodeBuild

A build of the https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] on a MacOS using XCode build system.

To build the code run from the repository root directory:
----
xcodebuild

= Code Description

An example of a flawed C++ code. The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is meant to be compiled with different build systems using different CI pipelines on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is forked into other repositories in https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples[this collection] to add a specific build system, platform, and CI.
The downstream repositories are analyzed either with https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] or https://sonarcloud.io/[SonarCloud].
